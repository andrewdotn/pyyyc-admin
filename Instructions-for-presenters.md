## Proposing talks

If you’d like to give a talk, come to a meetup and tell us about your talk
idea. At the end of each meetup, we plan what’s going to happen at the next
meetup.

## When your talk idea is accepted

As soon as possible, send an email to organizers@pyyyc.org confirming that
you’ll be giving a talk.

All arrangements for the talk will be handled over email. People check
their email much more often than their meetup messages, and with email it’s
easy to cc: people so that everyone’s in the loop.

## Two weeks before your talk

Please send a short abstract of your talk no more than two weeks before the
date. If you have a slide or interesting visual related to your talk that
could go in the meetup announcement to get people’s attention, please send
that along as well.

If you don’t send us an abstract, we’ll reach out to you to confirm that
you’ll be giving the talk. If we don’t have your email address, or don’t
hear back from you, we’ll ask someone else to fill in, and your talk will
have to be postponed to a future meetup.

## Before the talk

If you email us a link to your slides and/or code, we can post them on the
website, and someone else will have a copy in case your laptop has trouble
during the talk.

If you’d like to practice your talk or get feedback on an idea before the
talk itself, just let us know.

## The day of the talk

The projector has an HDMI cable. If your laptop doesn’t have an HDMI port,
let us know so that we can make sure to bring the appropriate cables or
adapters for you.

## After the talk

If you didn’t do so before the talk, please send your slides and code to
organizers@pyyyc.org so we can post them on the website and GitHub.
