## Meetup

http://www.meetup.com/py-yyc/

Uses RBAC, so there’s no master password.

There can only be one organizer, and the organizer has to pay a
subscription fee to remain organizer. The subscription fee is not
refundable or transferable if there’s a change in organizers; the new
organizer has to pay for their own subscription.
