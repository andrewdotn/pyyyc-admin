== Python feature: f-strings

Prefix a string with `f` and you can refer to variables directly

[source,python]
----
x = 1
print(f'x is {x}') # <1>
----

prints

----
x is 1
----

Python 3.6+, see https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/[PEP 498]

=== Expressions

[source,python]
----
total = 12
count = 5
print(f'average is {total / count}')
----

prints

----
average is 2.4
----

=== Formatting

After the variable or expression, you can include a colon and a format
string:

[source,python]
----
print(f'average is {total / count:.2f}') # <1>

now = datetime.datetime.utcnow()
print(f'today is {now:%Y-%m-%d}') # <2>
----
<1> prints `average is 2.40`, instead of `2.4`
<2> prints `today is 2019-04-24`
